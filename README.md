This is an experimental search obfuscation tool that attempts to make your search history mostly useless to people that might want to do naughty things with it.  Its designed to run in client-side code using plain html and JavaScript for Greasemonkey, which is only used due to the cross-domain fetching ability of GM_xmlhttpRequest.

This is NOT the Haystack Network, which is the broken anti-censorship network for Iran that turned out to be made of popsicle sticks and broken promises.  They don't release source code, just lots of requests for funds.

We're different, and we want your help.  Take a look at our code help us throw a wrench at a machine of mass data retention.
