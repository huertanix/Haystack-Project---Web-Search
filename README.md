Hayst.ac (formerly Haystack Project)

Release: Jerry Fabin (0.0)

This is the first POC of search obfuscation made in 2008. It does not obfuscate the search result that was clicked on, which is something Google began tracking in 2009 when it got all ajaxy. You should not use this version save for amusement at its novel use of iframes.
