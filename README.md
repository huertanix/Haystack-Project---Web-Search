Hayst.ac (formerly Haystack Project)
====================================
**Release: Donna Hawthorne (0.2)**

Hayst.ac makes a mess of your web search history. It will do so as a Chrome/Chromium plugin once that code is actually written.

Ancient History
---------------

A long time ago, in a desert far, far away...

TEMPE, ARIZONA (2008): Young Huerta feels unsatisfied working at a startup that leaves no time for side projects.
The market crashes, Huerta is let go of his jerb and takes a trip down the the west coast from Vancouver, BC, 
returning to Tempe eager to tackle a problem the forgotten co-founder of Tesla Motors wanted to solve but didn't.

With a sudden abundance of free time, Huerta spends it all on "Haystack Project" and all his severance pay on coffee,
which his trip in the Northwest gave him an appreciation for.  Many liters of coffee consumed and lines of code 
written and re-written later, Huerta find a way to add fake searches into his search history.

Returning to the northwest, Huerta presents this finding at Toorcamp, where hackers are fascinated by the idea of
search history obfuscation, although none manifest the interest in the form of code contributions. After a 
shenanigans-rich return to the Valley of the Sun, Huerta presents to local area tech communities with people walking 
out of presentation in complete disinterest or asking what the point is and who is this even for?

*For the future; The data Google collects now isn't going away when Google has their hand forced in turning it over.*

Google gets hacked by China. PRISM and Muscular secretly begin to poke holes into Google's innards. Google starts recording 
which results you click on in its search results page. Haystack Project can't fake that yet. Much JavaScript is inspected. 
Frustration ensues. On a trip to Idaho, Huerta wakes from a fever dream doused in sweat and suddenly knows exactly which 
key values to hook into in order to associate result clicks with a logged-in user's account. After an entire Caturday 
is spent on porting Haystack Project's code to Greasemonkey, "clickthroughs" are successfully faked.

The code is further fine-tuned and presented at the CFP Conference in San Jose in 2010. What is now called the "Charles Freck" 
release is debuted to an audience of one lawyer and a handful of curious ACM volunteers. Problems with randomization 
are encountered. It turns out that JS randomization isn't a thing that works in the year 2010 and few people are 
talking about it. A core Greasemonkey developer leaves for the Google Chrome team and implements Greasemonkey for Chrome 
in the least useful way possible, leaving Haystack Project alone in Firefox.

Some guy neglects to search for things called "Haystack" and creates "Haystack Network," a fundamentally broken system 
designed to help Iranian activists circumvent internet censorship. After it succeeds in gaining press from every outlet that 
ignored Haystack Project, security researchers hear of it and announce Haystack Network is horrendously awful and would 
do more to get Iranian activists get killed rather than help them. People confuse Haystack Project with Haystack Network.

Haystack Project is renamed Hayst.ac. Attempts to generate human-like search terms from more varied sources fail. 
Attempts at better JavaScript random number generation fail. Greasemonkey becomes a stagnant project and barely lives on 
in Firefox. A failed attempt at a Hayst.ac hackathon ends basically like this: http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=218.

Huerta moves to NYC. The project sits dormant.

Huerta visits Montreal and thinks deeply of the problems of the past and how they might be solved with the technology of the post-JavaScript-renaissance present, the year 2014; A lot of that thinking happens while stuck in a train for 15 hours due to having a hangover instead of wifi.

The project resumes.
